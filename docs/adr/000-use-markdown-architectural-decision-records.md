# Use Markdown Architectural Decision Records (MADR)

Should we record the architectural decisions made in this project?
And if we do, how to structure these recordings?

## Considered Options

* [MADR](https://github.com/adr/madr) - Markdown Architectural Decision Records
* [Michael Nygard's template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) - The first incarnation of the term "ADR". Maintainable by [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
* [Sustainable Architectural Decisions](https://www.infoq.com/articles/sustainable-architectural-design-decisions) - The Y-Statements
* Other templates listed at <https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record>
* No records

## Decision Outcome

* Chosen option: MADR
* The MADR template is lean and fits our development style.
